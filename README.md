# cacti-auto-install
This script is a semi-auto script that allows you to customize your cacti installation 
such as select the database name/password and install directory 

I will eventually have a full auto option as well populdated with the default values

this is currently written for debian/ubuntu but I am working on a centos/rhel script as well

This script is not finished yet 

TODO 

auto populate details in config.php<br>
auto download plugins<br>
